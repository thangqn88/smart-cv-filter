# CV Status Flow Fix

## Issue

The CV status was changing too quickly from "Uploaded" to "Processed", making it difficult for users to see the proper status progression.

## Root Cause

The text extraction process was happening so quickly that users couldn't see the intermediate "Uploaded" status before it changed to "Processing" and then "Processed".

## Solution

### Backend Changes (CVUploadService.cs)

1. **Added Delay in Background Processing**:

   - Added 1-second delay in `ExtractTextFromCVInBackgroundAsync()` before changing status to "Processing"
   - This ensures the "Uploaded" status is visible to users

2. **Added Delay in Synchronous Processing**:
   - Added 1-second delay in `ExtractTextFromCVAsync()` before changing status to "Processing"
   - Maintains consistency between both processing methods

### Frontend Changes (Details.cshtml)

3. **Enhanced Status Update Messages**:
   - Added status update message for "Uploaded" status: "File uploaded successfully!"
   - Users now get clear feedback for each status change

## Status Flow

The CV status now follows this clear progression:

1. **"Uploaded"** (Yellow badge) - File successfully uploaded

   - Shows for 1 second minimum
   - User sees: "File uploaded successfully!"

2. **"Processing"** (Blue badge with spinner) - Text extraction in progress

   - Shows during text extraction
   - User sees: "File started processing..."

3. **"Processed"** (Green badge) - Text extraction completed

   - Final status after successful processing
   - User sees: "File processing completed!"
   - Enables the "Screen CV" button

4. **"Error"** (Red badge) - Text extraction failed
   - Shows if processing fails
   - User sees: "File processing failed."

## Benefits

- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users can see each step of the process
- **Better UX**: Status changes are visible and meaningful
- **Proper Flow**: Status progression follows logical sequence
- **Consistent Behavior**: Both background and synchronous processing follow same pattern

## Testing

The changes have been tested and build successfully. The CV upload process now provides clear, visible status updates that users can follow from upload to completion.
