## AI Prompt Engineering Analysis

### Current Prompt Structure

The system uses a sophisticated multi-layered prompt approach:

#### 1. Base Prompt Template

```
You are an expert HR recruiter and technical interviewer with 15+ years of experience in talent acquisition.
Your task is to analyze a candidate's CV against a specific job posting and provide a comprehensive, objective assessment.

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
1. Be objective and fair in your assessment
2. Focus on relevant skills, experience, and qualifications
3. Consider both technical and soft skills
4. Look for growth potential and cultural fit indicators
5. Identify any red flags or concerns
6. Provide actionable insights for hiring decisions
```

#### 2. Job-Specific Prompts

The system dynamically generates job-specific analysis criteria for 10 different job types:

- **Software Development**: Technical skills, programming languages, frameworks, project portfolio
- **Marketing**: Digital marketing, analytics, campaign management, brand management
- **Sales**: Revenue generation, client relationships, business development
- **Finance**: Accounting, financial analysis, compliance, CPA qualifications
- **HR**: Talent acquisition, employee relations, policy development
- **Design**: UI/UX, graphic design, creative portfolio, design tools
- **Data Science**: Analytics, machine learning, statistics, data visualization
- **Management**: Leadership, strategic planning, team management
- **Operations**: Process improvement, supply chain, quality control
- **Customer Service**: Communication, problem-solving, CRM systems

#### 3. Experience Level Guidance

Different analysis criteria based on experience levels:

- **Entry Level**: Focus on education, internships, potential, learning ability
- **Mid Level**: Balance of experience and skills, career progression
- **Senior Level**: Leadership experience, complex problem-solving, mentoring
- **Lead Level**: Team leadership, strategic thinking, technical expertise
- **Executive Level**: Strategic vision, organizational impact, industry knowledge

#### 4. Scoring System

**Weighted Scoring Criteria:**

- Technical/Functional Skills: 30%
- Relevant Experience: 25%
- Education/Certifications: 15%
